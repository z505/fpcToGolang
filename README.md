# FPC To Golang
Project convert freepascal code to Golang (just basic conversion not super advanced)

I have a lot of procedural fpc code to convert to GoLang and I need a basic conversion tool so that's what this project intends to be.

For more advanced fpc code that uses inhertance and object orientation, that is something that could be focused on or patched of you have ideas. For now this will just take fpc code and convert whatever it can over to GoLang code with lots of human manual work needed for difficult code that cannot yet be converted.
